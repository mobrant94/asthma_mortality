RColorBrewer: A package that provides useful color palettes for graphics in R,
epitools: A package for epidemiological and public health statistics in R.

## Linear regression
Additionally, we employed linear regression as a statistical technique to model the relationship between an independent variable and a dependent variable. It's a way to understand how a change in the independent variable affects the dependent variable. Linear regression is represented by the equation:

ùëå = ùõΩ0 + ùõΩ1ùëã + ùúÄ 

Where:
Y is the dependent variable,
X is the independent variable,
ùõΩ0 is the intercept of the regression line,
ùõΩ1 is the regression coefficient representing the slope of the regression line, and
Œµ is the error term.

## Chi-square
After performing linear regression, the chi-square test was applied to assess the significance of the relationship between the variables. This test is useful for determining whether there is an association between two categorical variables.

## Mortality Rate
The asthma mortality rate per 100,000 population is a measure used to express asthma mortality in a given population adjusted for population size. The formula to calculate this rate is:

Asthma Mortality Rate: (Number of Deaths from Asthma/ Total Population) √ó 100,000

This formula calculates the number of deaths from asthma per 100,000 population, allowing comparisons between different populations regardless of population size. It's an important measure for assessing the impact of asthma in a particular region or period.
